This script simulated volume key press with a given interval to issue a shutter
on android devices. I use this to make timelapse using several photos over a
long time with the default camera app or Gcam.

* Usage
You need to have busybox installed. Copy the script to you phone. Start Termux or any other terminal emulator app
and run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sh timeLapseKeySimulator.sh
#+END_SRC

Depending on your android version/settings, you may need to have root access to
be able to issue key events
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
su
sh timeLapseKeySimulator.sh
#+END_SRC
