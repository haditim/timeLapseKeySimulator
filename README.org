This script simulates infinite number of volume key press with a given interval
to issue  camera shutter on android devices. I use this to make timelapse using
several photos over a long time with the default camera app or Gcam.

Once you gather all the photos, you can use [[https://hadi.timachi.com/2018/10/18/Timelapse_video_using_photos_taken_with_an_android_phone][this tutorial]] to make a video out of them.

* Usage
You need to have busybox installed. Copy the script to you phone. Start Termux or any other terminal emulator app
and run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sh timeLapseKeySimulator.sh
#+END_SRC

Depending on your android version/settings, you may need to have root access to
be able to issue key events
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
su
sh timeLapseKeySimulator.sh
#+END_SRC
